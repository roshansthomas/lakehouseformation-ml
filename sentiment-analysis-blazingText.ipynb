    "# Sentiment Analysis using Blazing Text Algorithm\n",
    "In this exercise we will be using the Sagemaker Blazing Text algorithm which provides highly optimized implementations of the Word2vec and text classification algorithm. Text classification is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task which can help determine the sentiment of a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a public dataset for our training activity. Blazing Text algorithm requires the input to be in a standard format. This format requires a statement and its corresponding label to be in a single line. \n",
    "If your training dataset is across multiple files, then these files have to be concatenanted to create a single file with all the text lines for the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about this algorithm [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/blazingtext.html)."
